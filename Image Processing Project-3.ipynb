This results in 64 connections, which will become the input for the second layer. We repeat the same step for the third and the fourth layers. The only change in the fourth layer will be that the output is 10 neurons, representing ten classes of the images.\n",

The forward step begins with the activation function, which is relu or Rectified Linear Activation.\n",

In simple terms, this means that at a time, only a few neurons are activated, making the network sparse and very efficient.\n",
